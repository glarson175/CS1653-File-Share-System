#Extra Credit - Phase 3
* For this phase, we implemented a Client GUI to make testing simpler and to make
the system easier to use for the user.
* Clients can only choose to download/delete existing files provided in a list (list of
   files is provided by listFiles implementation). Thus, users cannot even try to download files
   that they should not have access to while using the client GUI.
